## Contributing

We appreciate any and all efforts to help improve ochre. However, currently, we are still building the core of the engine, and need to finish this before considering any source contributions. Once this is complete, we will add documentation about how to contribute, so stay tuned!

## License

Currently, since the core of ochre is incomplete, there is no official license. Once we have a working core, we intend to use the MIT license so long as all dependencies are compatible.
